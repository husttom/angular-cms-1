## Getting started

Bower and Grunt depends on [**`Node`**](http://nodejs.org/) and [**`npm`**](https://www.npmjs.org/). Also make sure that [**`git`**](http://git-scm.com/) is installed as some bower packages require it to be fetched and installed.

### Install Grunt dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Usage

### Starting development application

##### Start your application without **`server`**:

```bash
$ grunt

##### Start your application with **`server`**:

```bash

```bash
$ grunt build
